# TeXLiveCI

A full TeXLive distribution in Docker image. 
The image is derived from [mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu](https://github.com/devcontainers/images) and continuous integration is enabled. 
The resulting image is pushed to [GitHub registry](ghcr.io/pzktit/TeXLive).
The Dockerfile used for build is a little modified work of [Island of TeX team](https://gitlab.com/islandoftex/images/texlive).


By now this repository is **UNDER CONSTRUCTION**.
